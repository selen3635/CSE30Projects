/********** Description **********/
  This program is going to draw a character S on the terminal. It requires
user to enter four digit number in order to run program. First number will
be between 4 to 1000 inclusively. This number dicide the width of character
S will be. The rest of three numbers all between 32 to 126 inclusively.
Second number is a value of a character that will represent the 'S'.
Third number is a value of a character that will fill in the empty space
inside the border. Fourth number is a value of a character that will make
up the rectangular border of the 'S'. Therefore, users are required to 
enter exactly 4 numbers, and each number must be in valid range. If any of
them are not satisfied, program will print error message on the terminal.
For example, if user enter less or more than 4 numbers, it will shows a
usage for user says that you have enter valid numbers. Also first number
must be even, so if user enter odd number. It will shows user to enter a 
even number. If user enter 4 numbers all within range, but third or fourth
number is equal to second number. This also will result a error message,
because third and fourth number must be different from second number.
If user entered 4 number all valid, it will print a character S on the 
terminal.


/********** How to compile **********/
  In order to compile this program, first we have to go to pa1 directory,
also make sure that all needed source files are in this directory. Since
this Makefile is provided and in this directory, Makefile contains command
to compile all source file. So just simply type conmmand "make" in your
current working terminal to compile the program.

/********** How to Run **********/
  After you compiled your program, there will be an a.out executable file
in pa1 directory. Instead of run a.out, we just type "./pa1 with numbers".
Since Makefile already include these. For example, you could type
"./pa1 10 32 88 124" to run program.


/********** Example of Normal Output **********/

[cs30xaeo@ieng9]:pa1:516$ ./pa1 8 45 63 35

The output will shows on terminal.

/********** Example of Abnormal Output **********/

[cs30xaeo@ieng9]:pa1:517$ ./pa1 3 34 34 34

        sWidth(3) must be within the range of [4 - 1000]

	sWidth(3) must be even

	sChar(34) and fillerChar(34) must be different

	sChar(34) and borderChar(34) must be different

The error message wil shows on the terminal.

/********** How to Test Program **********/
  In order to test program correctly, we have to compare the result from
my program and the result from tester. To make sure that our program works
correctly, we have to test some edge cases. Such as first number is not
even(./pa1 5 50 70 80). Third or fourth number is equal to second number.
(./pa1 6 40 40 40). Too many arguments(./pa1 2 40 40 40 40). Not enough
arguments(./pa1 2 38 38). Not valid number/out of range(./pa1 6 28 28 28)
Big numbers(./pa1 2000 300 300 300)...

/********** Questions **********/
1. Type "p/x $i0" to get a hexdecimal number which is 0xffbff207.
   Then type "x/s 0xffbff207" to print out 1st arg in strtol.

2. Type "p/x $i2" to get a hexdecimal number which is 0xa.
   Then type "p/d 0xa" to print the value of the base which is 10.

3. Type "p/x $i1" to print the hex value of &endptr which is 0xffbfeff4

4. Since my variable name is sWidth, so
   type "p sWidth" to print the value returned by strtol, which is 9.
   Another ways is to type "p $o0" to print the value return by strtol,
   which is 9.

5. Type "p/c *endptr" to print the character endptr is pointing to ,
   which is 'I'

6. Type "p endptr" to print entire- nul-terminated string endptr is
   pointing to, which is "InchNails".

7. Type "p/d errno" to print decimal value of the global variable errno,
   which is 0.

8. git status

9. git reset --hard

10. git diff HEAD 

11. To complete this assignment with integrity, i can't show my work with
my classmates, also i can't look at someone else code. If i have any
question with my program, i suppose to post my question on piazza, or i 
can go to lab and ask tutors. Tutors are really good source to help me
finish my assignment. Besides these, i also discuss some ideas with my
friends, however we don't show code to each other. Therefore, this is
how i finish my program with integrity.
